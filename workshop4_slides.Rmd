#What is reproducible research? 

\begin{center}
All analyses and graphics from a project \\ can be reproduced by \textbf{anyone} 
\end{center}
\vspace{0.5in}

To test your projects for reproducibility (in R):  
1. Clear your history/workspace.  
2. Highlight all of your code.  
3. Hit "Run." \vspace{0.2in}


#Why should we strive for reproducible research?

> - Transparency in our research 
\vspace{0.1in}
> - Promotes collaboration
\vspace{0.1in}
> - Others can easily build off of previous research
\vspace{0.1in}
> - Helps out future you!

#What is R Markdown?

\begin{center}
{\sl"R Markdown is an authoring format that enables easy creation of dynamic documents, presentations, and reports from R."} - RStudio

\end{center}

- combines ("knits" together) markdown syntax (a simple, plain-text markup language) with *chunks* of R code  

![R Markdown flow for document rendering](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/images/RMarkdownFlow.png)

#What can R Markdown do?

- PDF, Word, or HTML output for documents/reports
- PDF and HTML (Slidy or ioslides) output for presentations

![R Markdown output formats](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/images/RMarkdownOutputFormats.png)

#Creating and modifying a Rmd document script

To get started, install the `rmarkdown` package. You only need to do this once.
```{r markdown_install, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('rmarkdown')
library(rmarkdown)
```

Open a new R Markdown script: File > New file > R Markdown...  

Select output format   
- HTML or Word will work immediately  
- PDF requires full \TeX\ install  
Insert title and author(s)


#Integrating text and code chunks

- write plain-language description of what your code is doing \vspace{0.2in}
- write code chunk (offset by sets of 3 backticks) \vspace{0.2in}
- compile/render ("knit") often to check for errors \vspace{0.2in}


#Text markup options for Rmd documents

- `**bold**` or `__bold__` -> **bold**
- `*italic*` or `_italic_` -> *italic*
- heading levels
- ordered (numbered) and unordered lists
- tables
- insert links
- insert images
- inline code or equations \vspace{0.2in}

- \LaTeX\ markup can also be used within documents and presentations
- for example, `\vspace{0.2in}` adds 0.2 inches in between this line... \vspace{0.2in}

- and this line

#Code chunk options

\begin{center}
With the curly braces at the top of each code chunk, \newline 
e.g., \{r, tidy=TRUE\}, there are a number of options you can specify.
\end{center}

`echo = FALSE` -> don't print code in the document/presentation  
`eval = FALSE` -> don't evaluate code or print results  
`tidy = TRUE` -> reformat code in a tidy way for display  
`fig.width = 7` -> adjust width of figures (7 is default)  
`fig.height = 7` -> adjust height of figures (7 is default)  
\vspace{0.2in}
...and many more.

#Creating and modifying a Rmd presentation script

Identical to creating a new document script

- select output format
- insert title, author(s)

Text markup options for Rmd presentations

- does not support tables (yet)
- `#Header` starts a new slide, where `Header` is the slide title
- can also delineate between slides using `***` or `---` \vspace{0.2in}

- code chunk options are identical to Rmd documents

#Document and presentation templates

- a few document templates available through RStudio
- some presentation templates available online \vspace{0.2in}
- play around with templates to edit some components (e.g., color scheme)
- design your own template for re-use

#Continuing with R Markdown on your own

- There is a wealth of resources online
- Google is your friend
- Check out StackExchange and similar webpages
- Post questions in online forums
- New functionality constantly being developed

\begin{center}
As with most computer programming, there will be a steep learning curve at the beginning. Once you get the hang of things, your work will go faster. It may seem time-consuming at first, but it will save you \textbf{SO. MUCH. TIME.} later.

TL;DR: R Markdown + \LaTeX\ = Awesome Science
